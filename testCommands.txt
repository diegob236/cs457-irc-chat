hello everyone

This is a test client
It will display all implemented commands

/HELP
Wow that was helpful!

I wonder what version this server is
/VERSION 

What are the rules here?
/RULES 

I wonder what kind of awesome people made this Chat app?
/INFO

I would like to join the channel tea
/JOIN tea 

Nice, this is where the tea is!
/JOIN coffee

Now lets see all available channels
/LIST

/PING

/PONG

I wonder what time it is.
/TIME 

What is my hostname?
/USERHOST

What is my IP Address?
/USERIP

What is my username?
/USER 

Lets change that. I would like to be called BigBoss
/SETNAME BigBosss

/USER
Looks good! Oh wait, I didn't spell it right! 
I can also change my user name with /NICK
/NICK BigBoss 
/NICK 

Are there other ways to display my username?
/WHO
A future implementation will be to return more information about a user with the /who command

A way to check if someone is online is to run /WHOIS theirUsername
/WHOIS client1 

/WHOIS nobody

In fact, you can display everyone who is online with /USERS 
/USERS 
lower case commands also work just fine
/users 

It would be great if I was an Admin here.
/OPER BigBoss 

Oh, I guess I am just a test client 

/ISON BigBoss 
/JOIN WorldDomination

/INVITE MyMinion WorldDomination 

Oh yeah, its just me here.
/USERS 

Notice works like PrivMsg 
/NOTICE MyMinion you deserve a raise

/PRIVMSG MyMinion I'm just trying to tell you, you deserve a raise
Oh yeah, they must be online first.
Its quiet in here. 
/SILENCE

I had so much fun in this chat! Time to go.
Goodbye.
/QUIT
